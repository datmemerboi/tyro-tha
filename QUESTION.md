# Rick and Morty

## Background and problem

Claudia and her workmates absolutely love the TV show Rick and Morty! They often schedule parties where they just sit and watch the TV show all day long.

Because Claudia is such a big fan, she is always doing research on the characters to make sure she knows everything about them. Currently, she is studying all the human characters in the show.

Since there are so many characters in the show, Claudia finds it difficult to study them on her own, and would really love a web application that makes her studying easier.

## Challenge

Claudia would like you to build a simple React application that will do the following:

- Display a list of all the **human** characters from Rick and Morty. The list should simply display the name of each of these characters.
- When a character in the list is clicked, it should display a character profile with the following information:
  - The **status** of the character that was clicked.
  - The **origin** of the character that was clicked.
  - The **location** of the character that was clicked.

- The list of characters should be paginated.
- _optional_ An image of the character should be displayed when you click on the character in the list.
- _optional_ The ability to search the character list by a character name.
- _optional_ Include the date the character was created in the character profile.
- _optional_ Anything you want to add which could impress us ;)

## Guide

- An API is already provided for you. It is an open API (no authentication required). The documentation can be found here: <https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/>
  - Please use the **REST API** (NOT the GraphQL API). <https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest>
  - API base URL is <https://rickandmortyapi.com/api>, and has the following important endpoint:
    - `[GET] /character`
- It is recommended that you don't build your React application from scratch! Use a toolkit or framework!
- Typescript is recommended.
- Writing tests would be amazing.

## Criteria

Your work will be evaluated on:

- Approach to managing/displaying state,
- Approach to testing the application,
- Approach to handling API error responses,
- Code format and style.

## Notes

- Feel free to use whatever tools and libraries you want, however, please justify why you used them in your project's readme!
